                  Fosfomycin is a novel class of antibacterial drugs with a chemical structure unrelated to other known antibiotics. It is a bactericidal drug that disrupts cell wall synthesis by inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase and thus interferes with the production of peptidoglycan. Fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of UTIs, particularly those caused by E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and in combination with other antibiotics in the treatment of nosocomial infections due to resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
                  It is mainly used for infection caused by colibacillosis,salmonellosis,Klebsiella disease,head swollen syndrome,staphylococcus,streptococcicosis of poultry and pig, omphalitis, osteomyelitis ,encephalitis and Pasteurella,vibrio,streptococcus of fish,shrimp and other gram-negative bacteria.

                  Furazolidone is a nitrofuran antibacterial agent and monoamine oxidase inhibitor. This product is a nitrofurans antimicrobials. Of gram positive and negative of all have certain antibacterial function, including salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli and s. aureus bacteria, dung enterococcus, s. pyogenes, campylobacter, bacteroides, etc., under certain concentration of trichomonas, jia first giardia is active. It is action mechanism for interfering with REDOX enzyme which blocks the normal metabolism of bacteria. Furazolidones is used to treat bacterial and protozoal infections. It works by killing bacteria and protozoa (tiny, one-celled animals). Some protozoa are parasites that can cause many different kinds of infections in the body. Furazolidones is taken by mouth. It works inside the intestinal tract to treat cholera, colitis, and/or diarrhea caused by bacteria, and giardiasis. Furazolidones is sometimes given with other medicines for bacterial infections.
